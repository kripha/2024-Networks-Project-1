# 2024-Networks-Project-1

The project is broken up into three stages (plus the initial set up to get you ready for the stages):
- [X] In the preliminary stage, you will implement a simple proxy that sequentially handles clients and passes messages back and forth between client and server without modifying the messages.
- [ ] In the intermediate stage,  you will extend the proxy to forward HTTP request between a web browser and web server.
- [ ] In the final stage, you will extend the proxy to implement the full functionality described above, with the proxy modifying HTTP requests to perform bitrate adaptation.
